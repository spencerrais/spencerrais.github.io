This blog will loosely follow my personal project I devote much of my time to
and will likely touch upon the following general aspects: 
- Data pipelining, transformation, and dimensioning
- Application development 
- API development
- Software development workflow (Neovim, tmux)
- Markets and how to find opportunites algorithmically
- Testing different market strategies
- Identifying patterns in time series
## Tech Stack

This is not all-inclusive, but it is what I choose to work with currently. 

### Programming Languages 
- Python: Flexible, fast enough, and has a huge data community
- Golang: Fast and easy to use for API development as well as webservers
- Typescript: Default frontend language with less pitfalls than Javascript
- SQL: Generally the best way to transform data

### Software 
- PostgreSQL: Excellent OSS OLTP relational database
- Airflow: Data pipeline tool where pipelines live as Python 
- dbt: SQL transformations and testing that live in code
- Kafka: Event streaming platform used for streaming data
- Docker: Container software that allows for application-centric development

### Tools
- Neovim: Write and edit text at the speed of light
- tmux: Never leave the terminal
